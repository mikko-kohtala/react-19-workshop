# React 19 Workshop

Interactive workshop exploring React 19's new features including Server Components, Server Actions, and enhanced Context API. Built with Next.js 15 and TypeScript.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This workshop teaches experienced React/TypeScript developers about:

- **React Server Components (RSC)**: Server-side rendering for faster loads and smaller bundles
- **Client/Server Directives**: Proper usage of 'use client' and 'use server'
- **Server Actions**: Handle form submissions directly on the server without API routes
- **React 19 Improvements**: Enhanced Context API with use() hook for simplified Context consumption

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Bun 1.0+
- Experience with React, TypeScript. Next.js experience helps.
- Basic understanding of server-side rendering concepts

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:pitkane/react-19-workshop.git
cd react-19-workshop

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the development server
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the workshop.
